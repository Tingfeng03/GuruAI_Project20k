    "chain_of_thought": "The user wants a 14-day relaxed-pace trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, from 2025-02-20 to 2025-03-06, focusing on cultural tours, historical sites, local markets, and Vietnamese cuisine. They are 3 travelers needing 2 rooms and have a moderate budget.  My plan is to create an itinerary that balances popular attractions with unique local experiences, incorporating both indoor and outdoor activities while considering potential February festivals.  I'll prioritize Hanoi's must-sees in the first week and then suggest day trips and potentially an overnight trip to nearby destinations like Ha Long Bay or Ninh Binh in the second week to avoid staying in one place for too long.  I'll also include specific restaurant recommendations known for authentic Vietnamese cuisine and factor in travel time between locations to maintain the relaxed pace.  Since Tet (Lunar New Year) often falls in February, I'll research its timing for 2025 and incorporate related activities if applicable.",
